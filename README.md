# mui-mas
The SHAES Farm Material UI-based component library

In Spanish "mui mas" means "much more", and that is what we provide in this component library; much more than your basic set of Material UI components. We have spent years developing enterprise applications, and we've used that experience to develop an opinionated set of MUI components that allow us to quickly construct functionality common to most enterprise applications. With <code>mui-mas</code> we can scaffold an app in minutes, instead of hours, or days. Get professional looking enterprise applications quickly, customized to your workflows.
